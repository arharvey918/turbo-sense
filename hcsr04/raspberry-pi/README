INTRODUCTION
------------
Turbosense was created for the 2014 Firefighting Drone Challenge hosted by North
Carolina State University.  Its purpose is to take concurrent measurements using
ten HCSR-04 ultrasonic sensors and output a rectangular prism of free space
around the drone.  For more information, please see the report in the root
directory of this project.  


REQUIREMENTS
------------
In addition to the standard C libraries, this code also depends on the pigpio
library.  Instructions on setting up this library can be found here:
 * http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/

It is strongly recommended that you run a real-time kernel when using this code.
Real time kernels can significantly reduce latency in a system.


COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
To compile this code, run 'make'.  An executable named 'multisense_rt' will be
generated.

Configuration options for the code can be found in sensor.cfg.

To run the executable, you must be in the realtime group or execute the program
as the root user:
 $ sudo ./multisense_rt

A confirmation of the options selected in sensor.cfg will appear.  You will have
to press <ENTER> to run the program.
